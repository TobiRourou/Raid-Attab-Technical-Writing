# Cloud Gaming Explained

## What is Cloud Gaming?
Cloud Gaming, among other cloud services, is a streaming-based service, much like Netflix, that allows you play games run in remote powerful servers from your PC, Console, Tablet or phone. Much of the effort is done by the service's end by maintaining solid CPU and GPU performance along with consistent video compression while the end user is required to have a fast internet connection along with the game-specific input device (keyboard/controller).
## When did Cloud Gaming become a thing?
Cloud Gaming as a concept has never seen the light of day until E3 2000, as the service was announced by G-Cluster startup. The service consisted of providing remote access to PC Games that ran on their servers through customer-friendly portals.

Here are the three main components of Cloud Gaming:

- **The Product:** Either games whose license you already own or games that are provided to you through a certain subscription.

  See more on that in [What are the most famous cloud gaming services out there?](https://github.com/TobiRourou/Raid-Attab-Technical-Writing/wiki/_new?wiki%5Bname%5D=_Footer#what-are-the-most-famous-cloud-gaming-services-out-there)

- **The Channel:** A Cloud Gaming platform will stream live gameplay that is run by their servers (and their hardware) to your end through a series of compressed frames.

  | **Server Component**     | **Role** |
  | ----------- | -----------|
  | Fast CPU     |   Processing Physics, AI and game code/logic   |
    Powerful GPU   | Rendering graphics, balancing between performance and high resolution        |
  | Memory Management | Handling the game's data instead of your own storage |
  | API Management | Input Handling, Video Streaming, User Authentication | 
  | Video Codecs| Compressing streamed video data |


- **The User**: The user is required to send input either through touch if you stream the game to your phone, or through controller and Keyboard if you stream it to your PC. 

<ins>**Important Requirements:**

- **Network Transmission:** the process requires a strong bandwith in order to achieve Low latency (MORE TO BE ADDED). In other words, the stronger the bandwith is, the clearer the transmitted images are and the faster your input transmission is.

   Here are the minimum requirements for a bandwith to be suitable for Cloud gaming:
     
     - 25-50 Mbps download speed
     - 5-10 Mbps upload speed
     - Ping rate of 20 ms or lower


- **Regional Availability:** As the feature is relatively new in comparison tothe industry's age, it is not yet available throughout the world. As a user, you need to check each platform's conditions regarding the available regions for the feature to function.

## What about FPS ?
In a lot of cases, a game's performance through Cloud Gaming is highly dependent on the game itself rather than the service. A lot of games allow you to switch from Performance (60 FPS) to Fidelity mode (30 FPS), as the games are played in servers with console specs which may explained why the FPS is capped.



However, there are cases in which outside factors may have an effect on the performance, as in the following:

- **Clarity Boost Feature:** Cloud Gaming Services allow you to toggle a clarity boost feature which will lessen the grain and the blur effect in the stream. The video compression will focus on the delivering the highest quality possible as per your network bandwith, which will have an effect on the performance.
- **Bandwith**: spikes in your internet connection help elevate the framerate, and connect your input with its logic in the stream as fast as possible. However, lack of consistency and slower internet will both reduce the clarity of the stream, intiate late output and slow the performance overall.
- **Beta**: The service you are using, as Xbox Cloud Gaming, can be at the beta stage, which may lower expectations of performance as it is still under development and monitoring. This means that high server load during peak hours can affect clarify and performance as well.
