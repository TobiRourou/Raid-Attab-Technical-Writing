# Cloud Gaming Explained

## What is Cloud Gaming?
Cloud Gaming, among other cloud services, is a streaming-based service, much like Netflix, that allows you play games run in remote powerful servers from your PC, Console, Tablet or phone. Much of the effort is done by the service's end by maintaining solid CPU and GPU performance along with consistent video compression while the end user is required to have a fast internet connection along with the game-specific input device (keyboard/controller).
## When did Cloud Gaming become a thing?
Cloud Gaming as a concept has never seen the light of day until E3 2000, as the service was announced by G-Cluster startup. The service consisted of providing remote access to PC Games that ran on their servers through customer-friendly portals.

Here are the three main components of Cloud Gaming:

- **The Product:** Either games whose license you already own or games that are provided to you through a certain subscription.

- **The Channel:** A Cloud Gaming platform will stream live gameplay that is run by their servers (and their hardware) to your end through a series of compressed frames.

  | **Server Component**     | **Role** |
  | ----------- | -----------|
  | Fast CPU     |   Processing Physics, AI and game code/logic   |
    Powerful GPU   | Rendering graphics, balancing between performance and high resolution        |
  | Memory Management | Handling the game's data instead of your own storage |
  | API Management | Input Handling, Video Streaming, User Authentication | 
  | Video Codecs| Compressing streamed video data |


- **The User**: The user is required to send input either through touch if you stream the game to your phone, or through controller and Keyboard if you stream it to your PC. 

<ins>**Important Requirements:**

- **Network Transmission:** the process requires a strong bandwith in order to achieve Low latency (MORE TO BE ADDED). In other words, the stronger the bandwith is, the clearer the transmitted images are and the faster your input transmission is.

   Here are the minimum requirements for a bandwith to be suitable for Cloud gaming:
     
     - 25-50 Mbps download speed
     - 5-10 Mbps upload speed
     - Ping rate of 20 ms or lower


- **Regional Availability:** As the feature is relatively new in comparison tothe industry's age, it is not yet available throughout the world. As a user, you need to check each platform's conditions regarding the available regions for the feature to function.

## What about FPS ?
In a lot of cases, a game's performance through Cloud Gaming is highly dependent on the game itself rather than the service. A lot of games allow you to switch from Performance (60 FPS) to Fidelity mode (30 FPS), as the games are played in servers with console specs which may explained why the FPS is capped.

However, there are cases in which outside factors may have an effect on the performance, as in the following:

- **Clarity Boost Feature:** Cloud Gaming Services allow you to toggle a clarity boost feature which will lessen the grain and the blur effect in the stream. The video compression will focus on the delivering the highest quality possible as per your network bandwith, which will have an effect on the performance.
  
- **Bandwith**: spikes in your internet connection help elevate the framerate, and connect your input with its logic in the stream as fast as possible. However, lack of consistency and slower internet will both reduce the clarity of the stream, intiate late output and slow the performance overall.
  
- **Beta**: The service you are using, as Xbox Cloud Gaming, can be at the beta stage, which may lower expectations of performance as it is still under development and monitoring. This means that high server load during peak hours can affect clarify and performance as well.

## Is there a daily limit to Cloud Gaming?
Until now, across all platforms, there is no actual limit to Cloud Gaming except for the end of the subscription service as it is not a one time purchase.

 However, one should bear in mind that after an extended period of playing, experiencing latency can be a direct result of server overload. The frequency of server overload depends on the chosen service's number and power of their servers within their data cetners. To adjust this, Cloud Gaming Services use game-specific queues for users that are decided based on the type of paid subscription.

 Update: Geforce Now announced that, as of 01/01/2025, there will be a monthly limit of 100 hours.

 > "At the start of next year, GeForce NOW will roll out a 100-hour monthly playtime allowance to continue providing exceptional quality and speed — as well as shorter queue times — for Performance and Ultimate members. This ample limit comfortably accommodates 94% of members, who typically enjoy the service well within this timeframe." -[Nvidia](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-performance-membership/)

## How Safe is Cloud Gaming?
Overall, Cloud Gaming is generally labeled as a secure service, especially when run by reputable providers like Nvidia or Microsoft.

Here's why:

- **Consistent security updates**: Cloud Gaming platforms release consistent updates, not only to optimize the experience and address issues, but also to reinforce security measures as well.
  
- **Smaller possibility for in-game Cheat and Hacking**: As the games are stored in a cloud-based storage base, the possibiliy for hacking and in-game cheating is greately reduced as they often require a local path that is sheltered from the platform's security reach.

However, there are some serious risks to be concerned about as well.

- **Privacy and Monitoring**: As you are no longer playing offline without connection to the platform, there is a certain level of monitoring, even automatic in order for the platform to gather survey results in service of their own business plan. For a lot of gamers, this loss of privacy can be quite concerning.
  
- **Account Theft/hijacking**: You are also not exempted from account theft and hijacking. When your account has access to a large library of games, your consistent presence online in the Cloud incites the possibility of attempts of account theft in order for it to be resold later. This is a lot more common than you might imagine.
  
- **Weak encryption**: The channel that is streaming the content to your end and receiving your input is expected to be encrypted. The gaps in the encryption allow for hackers to hijack the process and exploit it for different purposes.
  
- **Vulnerabilities in APIs**: Much similar to the encryption, APIs help connect the games with the platform as they are run by two different entities. In-game payments also include APIs as they connect the player to a certain portal for payments. As Cloud Gaming is a service that is fully online, including a gigantic library of games with different services and APIS with the provider's servers running almost simultaneously. The gaps in APIs can also be exploited for the purposes of hacking and extracting information regarding your accounts and payments. This can only be amended with more security updates by the service provider.

## Conclusion: Should I fully switch to Cloud Gaming now?

It can be agreeable that Cloud Gaming offers a cheaper option for gaming that, when choosing the right service along with the right set of requirements from the user's end, presents the customer with a relatively satisfactory experience.

However, there are some important details to remember before fully switching to Cloud Gaming that may convince you to reconsider your decision.

- **Service Lifecycle**: Not owning the hardware in which you run the games you own can be regarded as a risky move. Aside from the different outages and maintenance operations that will prevent you accessing the service for a certain timeperiod, lack of content, traction and technical support for arising issues may lead to the end of Cloud Gaming. A prominent example would be how [Google Stadia](https://stadia.google.com/gg/) was shut down in 2023 because of the said factors.

- **Game Ownership**: This is more related to games that are available per subscription rather than license. In case of Xbox Cloud Gaming, games occasionally drop on Game Pass Ultimate and then leave after a while. This is a reminder that servers cannot store an infinite amount of games, and the list needs to be updated as per deals with game developers and storage requirements.

- **Privacy concerns**: Again, as Cloud Gaming is a fully digital service, the privacy concerns that are raised above, from monitoring, account theft and encryption vulnerabilities, can put your accesses at a high risk.

In a way, Cloud Gaming as an option can be a great choice, but only when it is not your only option for gaming.
