# Introduction
In 2019, I was a freshman in university with a lot of time in my hands due to the pandemic and the lockdown. I was an English major with an interest in media work, and I wanted to make a blog. I used to think that the process includes a lot of coding, which I was not interested in doing at the time, but that is not the case. It turns out if you learn coding, you will have better control over your website, but that is not a requisite nowadays. With a short budget, you are now able to create a fully capable blog with the potential to gain visitors, the same as any other giant in the search bar.

> üìç*Before we proceed, here are some keywords to keep in mind as you read the post: **Domain Name, Web Hosting, Search Engine Optimization (SEO), Security Sockets Layer (SSL)**.*

# Domain

A Domain name is basically your personal identification in the URL. It is what people type to find your website. Once you acquire a domain name, no other user on the internet can have the exact same domain name as you do.

<ins>üî¥***This is a very important requisite for your website as you won't be able to have your own blog without it***</ins>

<img width= "500" alt="Domain name" img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/def7bd6e-b614-4319-9477-0070058d87e3" />

To know if your domain name is taken, you can use a multitude of search services in the internet like <ins>[Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/domains/registration/results/?domain=googlo)<ins/>
 
Here is an example of an original domain name

<img width="500" alt="Domains" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6dba9900-7ef2-425c-a2f2-d6240d5426c2" />

There are various services you can use to buy a domain name, among which are the following

- [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com)
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com)
- [Domains](https://domains.com)
- [Ionos](https://www.ionos.com)

>üìç*You may find domain names that look like the following example: www.mydomainname.blogger.com*
>üî¥<ins>***This means that whoever opened the website does not own the domain name and is using a given domain by the [platform](Platforms) due to a free plan (click to know more or keep scrolling down).***<ins/>


# Hosting

Web hosting is a service that allows you to have your own personal database of information. You can imagine it as if you are renting a business address in your name in which all of your files are kept, but that address takes place in the digital world of the internet.

>üìç*<ins>The kind of database that is hosted by the web hosting service includes the following: **Credentials, email connectivity and storage</ins>**.*

Often times, the same services that provide domain names are the same ones that provide web hosting services.

Here are notable examples:

- [Bluehost](https://www.bluehost.com/)
- [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/m)
- [DreamHost](https://www.dreamhost.com/)
- [HostGator](https://www.hostgator.com/)
- [Ionos](https://www.ionos.com/)

<ins>üî¥***Web hosting is as important as having a domain name; you won't be able to create your blog without it***</ins>

# Platform
Usually, after acquiring the domain name and the hosting, you can create pages and blog posts, using HTML and CSS for the format and the layout. However, for the purposes of this guide, let us pretend that you do not wish to handle the coding and focus on the writing instead (even though it is highly recommended if you think about going pro while blogging).

><ins>***üìçA platform is your own personal playground which simplifies the coding in the form of a menu where you can create pages, blog posts, make headers, format texts, install plugins and more.***</ins>

><ins>**üìçPlugins are extra features that extend the capabilities of your platform as it allows you to do more with your website. Here are notable examples of Wordpress plugins:**
>> [Duplicator](https://duplicator.com/) is a plugin that allows you to "migrate, transfer, or clone your WordPress site between domains or hosts with no downtime."
>> [WooCommerce](https://woocommerce.com) "is the open-source ecommerce platform that helps merchants and developers build successful businesses for the long term."
>> [PublishPress](https://publishpress.com/) " is group of plugins that helps WordPress teams collaborate. You'll find an editorial calendar, authoring tools, and much more."

Here are notable examples of the most used platforms out there:
- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com)
- [Squarespace](https://fr.squarespace.com/)
- [Wix](https://fr.wix.com/)
- [Medium](https://medium.com/)
- [Blogger](https://www.blogger.com)

>ü§ñIf you have already tried accessing one of the platforms, you may have noticed that it allows you to open a blog for free without having to pay for the hosting or the domain name.
>- If you proceed with this option, your domain name will look like this: ***www.[your domain name].[Name of the platform].com***
>- This means that you will not own your website. You will also be allowed to experiment with the platform's free features, but <ins>you will not be allowed to install certain plugins like google adsense.</ins>
>- ***<ins>If you only seek to experiment without having to fully own your domain name or hosting, then this may be the perfect option for you</ins>***

# SSL 
Have you ever wondered why some URLs begin with HTTP and some others with HTTPS? This difference is marked by whether the owner of the website has acquired an SSL certificate.

>***<ins>A Secure Sockets Layer (or SSL) Certificate (originally founded in 2013 following the [Case of Edward Snowden](https://www.whistleblowers.org/news/the-case-of-edward-snowden/)) is a digital certificate that establishes an encrypted link between a server and a client.***

The client in this case is most likely: a website, browser, mail server and a mail client. This means that all of the data transmitted through your website to carry out different tasks such as credentials, social media accounts, payment information are all secured and encrypted.

You need to acquire the SSL Certificate from a trusted Certifying Authority as it will work on establishing the certificate through a process of a key pair: A private key and a public key. The CA will work on creating a data structure in which your public key matches your private key, but the CA can never see the private key for security purposes.

Here is a list of all [Certifying Authorities that are trusted by browsers](https://pkic.org/ltl/)

><ins>***üìçWith that said, you do not need to worry beause your Web Hosting provider will guide you through the process of acquiring a SSL Certificate as it is a must to maintain your hosting and the trust of your users.***<ins/>
